# RabbitInTheMaze

A Unity-based maze exploration game where players navigate through procedurally generated levels as a rabbit, collecting keys and avoiding enemies in an Alice in Wonderland-themed environment. This project was developed as part of the CS 410 course.

## Project Overview

Rabbit In The Maze is a first-person perspective game where players must navigate through increasingly challenging mazes. The game combines procedural generation with strategic gameplay, requiring players to find specific objects while avoiding enemies, manage resources, and discover the exit in each level. Through a unique blend of exploration and survival mechanics, players experience a dynamic environment that changes with each playthrough.

## Problem Statement

Many maze games offer static, predictable environments that become less engaging over time. This project aims to create a dynamic, replayable experience through procedural generation and progressive difficulty, encouraging players to develop new strategies with each playthrough. By incorporating elements of resource management and enemy avoidance, the game creates a compelling challenge that extends beyond simple maze navigation.

## Technical Requirements

The game is built using the Unity Engine and requires a C# development environment. Additional technical specifications and dependencies will be documented as development progresses.

## Core Features 

The game incorporates several innovative systems to create an engaging player experience:

* Procedural Generation: Each level offers a unique maze layout with progressively challenging designs
* Movement and Navigation: Grid-based movement system with a dynamic minimap that reveals through exploration
* Enemy System: Card soldiers patrol and pursue the player, creating dynamic challenges
* Progression Elements: Keys unlock new areas while power-ups provide strategic advantages

The game world is brought to life through an Alice in Wonderland aesthetic, with different areas connected via rabbit holes. A time challenge system encourages replay value and mastery of each level.

## Game Architecture

The technical foundation of Rabbit In The Maze consists of several integrated systems:

* Movement System: Grid-based navigation with precise control
* Generation System: Procedural algorithms for maze creation
* AI Framework: Enemy pathfinding and behavior patterns
* Progression System: Difficulty scaling and level advancement

## Development Team

Our project is developed by a dedicated team of four specialists:

* Alex: Developed maze generation algorithm, subbmitted meeting notes.
* Caden: Worked on developement of inventory system, and items
* Ellie: Sourced/integrated art assets, character movement, & particle effects
* Russell: Developed and implements audio elements

## Development Process

Our collaborative development approach emphasizes iterative design and continuous refinement. The team focused on creating an engaging and replayable experience through careful implementation of procedural maze generation algorithms, sophisticated difficulty scaling, and intelligent pathfinding systems for enemy AI. Particular attention was paid to obstacle avoidance mechanics and the seamless integration of themed visual and audio elements.

## Reflection

The development of Rabbit In The Maze has provided valuable insights into both game design principles and collaborative development practices. Key challenges included:

* Balancing procedural generation with playability
* Implementing effective difficulty progression
* Creating engaging gameplay loops
* Maintaining thematic consistency

Through these challenges, we've developed a deeper understanding of creating engaging gameplay while maintaining thematic consistency.
